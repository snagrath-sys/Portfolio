Data from govt databases used to finetune Foundation model RETFound to detect galucoma using Optical Coherence Tomography imagings. Used lime, XRAI, layer GradCam, smooth Grad, guided GradCam, Integrated Gradients. saliency maps, occlusion, guided backprop, deconvolution, LRP, and IGOS to evaluate model learnings.
Used similarity metric *Jaccard* to identify similarities among model identifications and gold standard identifications of scan regions.
