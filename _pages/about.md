I am a Machine Learning Engineer specializing in medAI. Earned a Master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Southern California.

I have worked in the areas of opthamology and microbiology so far. I have been a part of distinguished research groups at [USC’s Information Sciences Institute](https://viterbischool.usc.edu/news/2022/11/ai4health-a-collab-for-the-future-of-health-care/), [USC Dornsife](https://dornsife.usc.edu/towerlab/people/), [Autonomous Networks Research Group](https://anrg.usc.edu/www/), and [DRDO](https://www.drdo.gov.in/drdo/).
My expertise spans the entire machine learning pipeline—from data wrangling and annotation supervision to building large-scale models and evaluating them using metrics like AUROC, mAP, and IoU. I have led teams of up to five members, successfully driving projects involving foundational models with over 340M parameters.

I have a work experience of about 3+ years. Beyond technical skills, I bring strong communication and leadership. My passion lies in utilizing AI to transform healthcare and deliver real-world solutions that improve patient outcomes.

In an alternate life I would have been a professional sportsperson, still could :P. 
I have been a national level shooter and squash player. Nowdays I indulge in strength training and long runs.
