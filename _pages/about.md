Hi, I am Shriya!
A Machine Learning Engineer specializing in medAI. I studied Computer Science at the University of Southern California, where I was a graduate researcher at: AI4Health+[USCâ€™s Information Sciences Institute](https://viterbischool.usc.edu/news/2022/11/ai4health-a-collab-for-the-future-of-health-care/), [USC Dornsife](https://dornsife.usc.edu/towerlab/people/), and [Autonomous Networks Research Group](https://anrg.usc.edu/www/). I was fortunate to have been advised by [Prof Michael Pazzani](https://www.isi.edu/directory/pazzani/) and [Prof John Tower](https://dornsife.usc.edu/profile/john-tower/).

My research interests lie in multimodal Deep Learning, explainability, and Generative AI. I have worked in the areas of opthamology, microbiology, and pathology. Deploying Foundation models to solve Vision problem statements. I also gained some experience in Natural Language early on, while working with a team of researchers from [IITB](https://www.iitb.ac.in/) and [DRDO](https://www.drdo.gov.in/drdo/).

My expertise spans the machine learning pipeline. I have led teams of up to five members, successfully driving projects involving foundational models with over 340M parameters.

I have a work experience of about 3+ years. Beyond technical skills, I bring strong communication and leadership. My passion lies in utilizing AI to transform healthcare and deliver real-world solutions that improve patient outcomes.
