I am a dedicated Machine Learning Engineer with a focus on advancing medical diagnosis through AI. With a Master’s degree in Computer Science from the University of Southern California, I have worked with multiple research labs to develop innovative solutions that address key challenges in healthcare. 

I have worked in the areas of opthamology and microbiology. My expertise spans the entire machine learning pipeline—from data wrangling and annotation supervision to building large-scale models and evaluating them using metrics like AUROC, mAP, and IoU. I have led teams of up to five members, successfully driving projects involving foundational models with over 340M parameters.

I have a work experience of about 3+ years. Beyond technical skills, I bring strong communication and leadership. My passion lies in utilizing AI to transform healthcare and deliver real-world solutions that improve patient outcomes.

In an alternate life I would have been a professional sportsperson, still could :P. 
I have been a national level shooter and squash player. Nowdays I indulge in strength training and long runs.
